[{"title":"My Dream in the New Era","url":"/2020/04/23/My-Dream-in-the-New-Era/","content":"As the rapid development of modern science and Internet technology, we are living in a new era, which features information appliance with information communicating and exchanging through Internet. President Xi proposed that we must strengthen the construction of information infrastructure, promote the deep integration of information resources and open up the \"big artery\" of information for economic and social development. Thus, creating and developing information technology help to build digital China. As a college student majoring in computer application technology in Information Engineering Department, I dream to be a software engineer.\n\nIn such information era, social economic structure in China centers on service industry, which aims at meeting the needs of people’s better life. In addition, knowledge innovation is the main trend of society development. I always consider how to apply the knowledge learned from my major to create useful and significant computer software to help people solve the problems in life or at work. At present, I have an idea to explore auto fire alarm software. So how did this idea come about? Last term, when I returned to school, I found a big fire in the mountain at the back of our dormitory building. In no time, high wind with dense smoke blew into our dormitory district. Immediately and urgently, I called 119. Then, the fireman on the phone asked me where it was. I was so nervous and spent a lot of effort to make it clear. As the mountain was too big, I couldn’t provide him with a very specific address. Finally, the firemen found the address and extinguished the fire. Afterwards, I wondered if there was any way for firemen to receive the locating map online in computer or smart phone. In such way, fire site could be chased immediately. Thus, I imagine creating auto fire alarm software. \n\nIn my imagination, the auto fire alarm software should possess the following function. Firstly, this software can capture the data of the weather, climate and geographical situation of the every location of the city at all times. Secondly, it can analyze the irregular data immediately according to the statistics of temperature, wind, air quality and so on. Thirdly, once the software inspects the irregular data of a location, it will automatically trigger a fire alarm by sending the GSP locating map of the fire to target receivers. The fire center can easily apply the software in the computer of the call center or smart phone of every fireman to receive the data. Every citizen should also install the software into smart phone so as to get informed of the fire or send the witnessed photos to the fire center. If this is achieved, it will greatly shorten the time of rescuing and evacuating the people in the fire spot.\n\nRealizing the significance of creating the auto fire alarm software, I am excited and eager to chase my dream right now. As a college student in grade one, I feel it crucial to master the core knowledge of software programming. In addition, I want to form an association at college to attract members who have great passion in this field. I also hope to receive support from my teachers to get precious supervision in the process of exploring the software of such kind.\n\n President Xi suggests that we roll up our sleeves and work with added energy to fulfill our dream. In the new era, I believe I can achieve my dream! I believe we can achieve our China Dream!","tags":["第六届岭南杯英语写作技能大赛","金笔奖"]},{"title":"在 ubuntu 环境下用 caps lock 切换输入法","url":"/2020/04/22/在-ubuntu-环境下用-caps-lock-切换输入法/","content":"## 安装 Gnome Tweak（已安装可跳过）\n打开 Terminal (终端），输入以下代码安装 Gnome Tweak\n```sh\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n```\n安装过程中遇到下面这句话\n```sh\nDo you want to continue?
